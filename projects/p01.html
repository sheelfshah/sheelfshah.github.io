          So Scotland Yard is a 6 player board game and before lockdown, I used to play it with friends in college. During quarantine, I had a lot of free time and I so I decided to attempt recreating the board game. This is what it looks like:<br><br>

        </p>
        <p>
          This is no small project. I've spent over 50 hours coding it, and atleast another 50 thinking about it and planning everything. There were days when I was so obsessed with the game that I spent 10 hours around it, but it was all worthhe game is simply beautiful, and I am so proud of it. All the small features I put in finally made meaning together, and it was such a journey. Here's the game in the lobby and in action: <br><br>

        </p>
        <p>
          You can check the game out <a href="not-scotland-yard.herokuapp.com/scotland_yard">here</a>. If Heroku has stopped its free hosting service before you could check it, hard luck! Finally, I would recommend everyone reading to try and build atleast some such major project where you spend several hours every day for 2 months straight, because the process of small inputs accumulating into something huge is one that everyone should experience.
