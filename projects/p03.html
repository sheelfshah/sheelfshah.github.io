          This was one of the best labs I've had. My teammates, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/siddhi-bagul-1817481a0/">Siddhi</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/mitali-meratwal-01473b1a6/">Mitali</a>, were simply brilliant. The project involved ascpects of design, implementation and testing, giving us a complete picture of how electrical circuits were built in practice.<br>

          Here's one of our subcircuits:<br><br>

          We spent many late hours at the lab, scrambling for components, designing circuits on specialized software and then debugging them. Our consistent efforts did pay off when we saw our sytem, with all its subparts, work flawlessy to transmit and receive data over several meters at high speeds.

          I thoroughly enjoyed the process of formal research, involving a literature survey and so much trial and error. I must also give credit to Prof. Kalayankrishan, who was a terrific guide. The report, with all the technicalities of the project, can be found at <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.08263">arXiv:2210.08263 [cs.AI]</a>.
