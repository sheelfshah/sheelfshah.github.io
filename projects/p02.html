          Connect 4 is a popular board game in which two players alternately take turns dropping their respective tokens on a 6 Ã— 7 board. It has been solved, and it can be shown that the player going first can always win. ConnectX is a generalizaton of this game. Our algorithm has to learn to play across variable board sizes and might have to connect more than 4 tokens, and this makes the task significantly more challenging.<br><br>

          I teamed up with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/shubham-gupta-a48069170/">Shubham Gupta</a> to attempt to create an agent to play ConnectX as the course project in an advanced Reinforcement Learning course under <a href="https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~shivaram/">Prof. Shivaram Kalayankrishnan</a>.

          I thoroughly enjoyed the process of formal research, involving a literature survey and so much trial and error. I must also give credit to Prof. Kalayankrishan, who was a terrific guide. The report, with all the technicalities of the project, can be found at <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.08263">arXiv:2210.08263 [cs.AI]</a>.
