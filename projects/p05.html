          For over 25 years, Suresh Ghelabhai Gada of Gagodar village has devoted himself - physically, mentally, and financially - to the service of the environment, cows, and the people of Kutch. His work builds a CV that rivals those of the most successful businessmen and he did it all only because he felt it was the right thing to do.

        <h3>
          1. Grass Plantation
        </h3>
        <p>
          In India, <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-34513185">cows are revered</a>, and every year, <a href="https://www.shivaa.org/product/cow-puja-seva/">vast amounts of money are donated</a> to support their care and nutrition.
          Yet, Sureshbhai saw a deeper opportunity. Instead of relying on expensive, one-time feed donations, he asked: Why not create sustainable, long-term food sources for cows that require minimal intervention and offer lasting impact?
          With no formal training but a keen understanding of the land, Sureshbhai taught himself farming through observation and experience. He made a conscious and informed choice to cultivate native grass varieties -- crops that are nutrient-rich, drought-resistant, and low-maintenance. These grasses regenerate on their own and withstand even extreme conditions like prolonged drought or wildfire.
          Since 2001, he has worked tirelessly to plant these grasses on common lands in villages such as 
          <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/4CqqWjma9LYUKGAx9">Ghanithar</a>, 
          <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/X2jeCVkzEmGpLkES9">Gagodar</a>, 
          <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/Nsu1XXXEE9JYKo7P6">Samkhiyari</a>, 
          <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/5LT874E8sZL5zLLR8">Kharai</a>, 
          <a href="">Kuda</a>, 
          <a href="">Suthri Bandhani</a>, and 
          <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/6Wnyjx2p5CczFegv6">Ner</a> across the Kutch region. He personally sources seeds from <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/zMsJRwJ1eyeXXWVk8">Rajasthan</a>, often at his own expense, sows them himself, and transforms fallow, unused land into thriving grazing fields.
          The impact is far-reaching: cows now have access to consistent, natural fodder; local ecosystems have been revived; and livelihoods have been created in the process. Sureshbhai's work stands as a powerful example of how sustainable agriculture, when guided by vision and commitment, can serve both community and environment.
        </p>
        
        <h3>
          2. Tree Plantation
        </h3>
        <p>
          Seeing animals struggle for shade under tiny trees inspired Sureshbhai to begin large-scale planting of indigenous trees like mango, tamarind, jamun, gunda, pipal, and banyan. These trees offer fruit, shelter, and environmental benefits.
        </p>
        <p>
          Thanks to his efforts, over 3,000 trees now thrive in the region. In 2021 alone, he planted 200 pipal and banyan trees, helping turn dry lands fertile and offering relief to people and animals alike.
        </p>
        
        <h3>3. Water Conservation</h3>
        <p>
          Water scarcity once forced families in Kuran and Jamkunriya, two border villages, to migrate for half the year. In 2003, Sureshbhai began digging lakes-starting with three in Ghanithar. Later, with the help of a local organization, he led efforts to build lakes in hilly areas, ensuring year-round water access and stopping migration.
        </p>
        <p>
          These lakes now serve both people and cattle, making life stable in once-difficult regions.
        </p>
        
        <h3>
          Additional Contributions
        </h3>
        <p>
          He has personally settled 35 cows and bulls for farmers in Gagodar and Ghanithar and provides pregnancy kits to care for them.
        </p>
        <p>
          He lives by indigenous values, promotes Khadi clothing, and supports locally made goods.
        </p>
        
        <h3>Vision for the Future: Oxygen Parks</h3>
        <p>
          Sureshbhai's next dream is to build Oxygen Parks-green spaces filled with medicinal plants, trees, walking paths, and rest areas. One such park is already underway in Gagodar, with a goal to expand to many more villages.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sureshbhai Gada's tireless work, driven by compassion and clarity of purpose, stands as a beacon of selfless service and sustainable development.
