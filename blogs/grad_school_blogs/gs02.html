          I remember waltzing into my 8:30 am class, 15 minutes late, still visibly drowsy. Attending lectures on time wasn't really on my top-priorities anymore. I had received painful rejections from MIT and Berkeley. As usual, I pulled out my phone and checked my Mail. I had received one from Stanford, my top-choice school. After a few anxious moments, fumbling with the portal, I had the decision in front of me. "Congratulations" was the only word I read. I immediately got up, left the class, and called my mom. After the call, and after double and triple-checking the admit, I texted the good news to a few select people. This was one of the happiest moments of my life. Things were finally coming together. <i>Perfectenschlag</i>.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, while this moment will always be remembered as the climax of my application cycle, It wasn't a straightforward journey for me, far from it. In this article, I want to focus on one of the critical aspects of the process, perhaps the most important of them: Dealing with application anxiety. But before I go ahead, I want to clarify a few things: 1) I am by no means a professional, so take my advice with a pinch of salt, and 2) I am not one of the calm and composed folks, In fact, throughout the cycle, I have had several bouts of emotional lows. But the emotional rollercoaster showed me a few things that I want to share with you.
        </p>
        <p>
          Pro-tips on skyrocketing your anxiety levels:
          <ul>
            <li>"My profile is no good"<br>
              Your profile in your final year is more or less fixed. Sure, that one extra research paper will help you out, but don't stress about it more than you need to. Also, remember that graduate admissions decisions are taken more based on potential rather than on direct merit. For PhD: <br>
              Does he/she have the potential to become a great researcher in XYZ field in the coming years with proper guidance?<br>
              For MS: <br>
              Does he/she have the potential to be a good student, pass our advanced courses, TA for some undergrads, and, most importantly, fill up our coffers?
            </li>
            <li>
              "He/She has a better profile than me." <br>
              Sure, some people have a better shot at grad schools than you do. That doesn't mean you won't stand a chance. I've compared my CPI, Projects, Recos, etc., with both batchmates and seniors quite minutely only to feel that I have no shot at certain schools. Leave the minute comparisons to the admissions committee; they get paid enough to do that.
            </li>
            <li>"Paisa Laya?"<br>
              <image src="../../img/blog_img/meme.png" class="blog-img">
                I was quite anxious about my funding scenario. While my parents assured me that they would financially support me, I did not want to take up big loans, neither from my parents nor from a bank. I decided to apply only to fully funded programs. If you're an MS applicant, I would suggest you figure this out soon.
            </li>
            <li> "He/She has more interviews/admits than me."<br>
              Again, this might happen when the results start rolling in. Fortunately, as a Ph.D. applicant, my interviews and admits came before the MS folks, but if you find yourself in this situation, remind yourself that what another person gets/doesn't get won't affect your results. Apna time ayega.
            </li>
            <li>
              "Lemme check my email again, kuch aya hoga"<br>
              I started doing this starting from Jan, repeatedly checking my email, and most times just finding a spam mail from some random university that got my email from the darn GRE contacts. Check emails regularly, twice a day, maybe, not every 10 minutes. I'd advise you not to check
              Gradcafe more than twice a week, but its something easier said than done.
            </li>
            <li>
              "Arey yaar, MIT ne kata diya" <br>
              Dealing with rejection is never easy. It always leaves you with a feeling of inadequacy. I couldn't
              help but feel that a university rejection meant that I'm not smart enough for them. Of course, this
              is total bs; universities don't have metrics to judge how "smart" you are. Always remember that there is a reason you are applying to around ten programs, If you get into all of them, you either have a god-like profile, or you were not ambitious enough in your university choices. Getting too depressed from a rejection from one university is a sure-shot way of throwing the other
              interviews you have lined up. Stay as positive as you can and believe in yourself.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
          Pro-tips on dealing with anxiety:<br>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Talk to profs<br>
              Your profs and internship advisors went through the same thing! They know how the process works quite well. I remember chatting for long hours with my project advisors about grad schools and, more importantly, my chances of getting into certain grad schools, and always leaving their office satisfied and smiling. Plus, this helps give a more human touch to your interactions with your recommenders, and that really will show in what they write about you!
            </li>
            <li>
              Discuss with your peers/seniors <br>
              Your peers/seniors understand what you're going through, especially the folks that are also applying or have applied before. They are excellent sources of information if you're a careless type of person. Some good-old elec-style rona helped me vent out frustrations to others rather than sulking alone in my room. Keep this in moderation though. I must apologize to some of my friends for the anxiety I possibly passed on.
            </li>
            <li>
              Family and close friends <br>
              Talking to family or close friends helped me take my mind off grad schools or at least vent out about it. It is always lovely to have those people who you feel would never judge you for your losses. My sister was this person for me.
            </li>
            <li>
              Focus on academics<br>
              Yes, your final year grades don't affect your grad applications so much. However, I surprisingly focussed more on acads in my final year compared to the years before. For one, it gives you something else to focus on. Also, since your final year courses will likely be linked to the fields you are interested in going into, it never hurts to build good foundations in the subject and solid relationships with these profs.
            </li>
            <li>
              Exercise<br>
              I can't stress how much the (almost) everyday jogging or gymming helped me. When I found myself feeling bummed out in my room, I used to whip out a few air-punches, push-ups, sit-ups, or squats. Apart from helping you with your anxiety, it's excellent for your health, a big win-win.
            </li>
            <li>
              Binging on food and movies<br>
              I developed a habit of ordering a medium-sized pizza or some burgers and fries while watching a movie, around twice a week. My pizza and movie ritual might have been unhealthy for my physical health, but it certainly was a welcome stress-buster. Of course, this is not for those of you who have decent amounts of self-control and can get through difficult things without literally bribing yourselves.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <br>
          I hope some of this advice will be relevant to you and help you with your quest to graduate studies.
        </p>
        <i>Good luck!</i>
