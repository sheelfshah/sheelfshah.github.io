        <p>I am Deepak Gopalan. I spent the summer after my junior year on a research internship at Boston University. As someone who is really into core elec and wants to pursue a career in research, going for a Univ intern was a no-brainer for me. At the time I was applying for internships, I had gotten really into IC design, and so I wanted to go for an internship that would let me hone my circuit design skills. <br>
          <p> <img src="../../img/blog_img/bu.jpg" class="blog-img"><br>
            I had applied to and got provisional acceptances from some of the circuits groups from MITACS, but when I learnt that there was actually a circuits Prof. from the US hiring an intern through PT Cell, I was really excited! I read up a bit about the Prof. and found out that she was quite new. But I saw that throughout her career, she had been guided by some of the pioneers in this field. I had also seen in my last year internship, that younger guides tend to be more hands-on when it comes to research, and that was something I really valued. The original JAF was about a signal processing project, but during the interview, I asked if I could be involved in other projects of my interest and learnt about other amazing ongoing projects. In the end, it worked out really well for me.<br></p>
          <p><b>Stay in Boston</b><br>I subletted a room for the two months. Rent in Boston is quite expensive compared to other places in the states, but I found one of the cheaper ones. My apartment mates were all from India, and were mostly Masters students in different universities. As a vegetarian, food is always a problem, but thankfully many of my apartment mates were also vegetarians, and we took turns making food. I finally learnt to make my own food from those guys! Plus, having a bunch of Indian guys and girls around, all just a few years elder to me, meant that I could get a lot of "fundae" from them while also having great company to chill with on weekends!</p><br>
          <p><b>Project Description:</b><br>
            During the internship, I was working on two different projects simultaneously.
            The first one was on compressive sensing used in spectrum sensors and the other was on ingestible capsules to detect bleeding in the GI tract.</p>
          <p><b>Compressive Sensing for Spectrum Scanners:</b><br>
            So all the devices that use wireless communication, transmit and receive data in the RF spectrum.
            With a surge in the number of these devices and with a limited spectrum, congestion has become a significant issue.<br>
            The primary, licensed user of the spectrum might not be using the spectrum at all times. <br>
            One way to ease the spectrum congestion is to have secondary users use the spectrum when the primary user is not using it.
            This is called dynamic spectrum sharing. To do this, we need sectrum scanners to identify unused spectra.<br>
            My role was to create models for different spectrum scanners.
            Some of these models were compressive sensing based, which is basically sub-nyquist sampling and recovery of sparse signals.
            The main purpose of the project was to assess the vulnerabilities of the different spectrum scanners and how easy/hard it is for an attacker to make the scanner unusable.
          </p>
          <p><b>Ingestible Capsule:</b><br>
            The other project I worked on was an ingestible capsule for detection of GI bleeding. Basically there are bacteria that are genetically modified to show illuminiscence in the presence of a chemical target such as blood. The emitted light is detected by a photodiode or a phototransistor and is used to determine the level of bleeding. <br>
            This is a huge project, with multiple groups involved. Apart from our circuits group from BU, there were groups from MIT who were working on the bacterial genetics part and the mechanical part of the capsule. The circuits part might sound really simple, even like an EDL level project, but the currents that we are trying to detect are at far range! Also, the whole system is inside the body, so powering it is a challenge. The circuits need to operate at a nW power level! This makes the whole design really challenging. <br>
          </p>
          <p>I was working on one of the components needed for the chip, the low power oscillator. I was also involved in the whole system level design. This project was a huge contrast from the previous one. That was a relatively small project, with only me and the Prof working on it, this was a huge, inter-diciplinary project, with work moving really slowly, but has a much larger impact when its complete. Plus I got to attend meetings at MIT and discuss challenging research problems with some of the best minds in the world, which was also amazing by itself!</p>
          <p><b>Overall Experience:</b>
            Overall, the internship was an awesome experience. I got to be part of some really exciting projects, which re-ignited my whole academia enthu. After this, I am really looking forward to going full time into research in the near (hopefully!) future, and I would encourage anyone from elec to go there for an internship next year!
