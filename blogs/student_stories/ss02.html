          Hi everyone, I am Koustav Jana, a 4th year EE student who has converted from BTech to Dual Degree(Microelectronics). I had taken this decision because of my interest in the field of Nanoelectronics and a conversion to DD would help me in exploring it further.
        </p>
        <p>
          The conversion process is quite straightforward and easy. The first and foremost thing that needs to be done is preparing a semester-wise course plan(in a PDF document) for the remaining semesters clearly mentioning how you are going to fulfil the credit requirements for your respective DD programme. For this you need to compare the curriculum of your respective DD programme with that of BTech and list down the additional courses a DD student is supposed to do apart from what a BTech student does. In my case, since I decided to convert before the start of my 7th semester I was due for 2 specialization electives, 1 institute elective and core courses like EE227, EE620 and EE352. <br>
          (<b>Note</b>: EE227 is not offered anymore so you will have to do one more specialisation elective as a replacement)<br>
          Now you can propose to finish these courses either by overloading yourself in the coming semesters given you do not cross the credit limits for your respective category or by retagging the additional courses(ALC/Honors), you might have done, into Institute/Specialization electives. Finally you need to get your course plan approved by your respective Faculty Advisor. 
        </p>
        <p>
          The next step is the application process. For this you just need to write an email to the HOD and the EE office(in cc) mentioning your current academic status(year of study, CPI, backlogs etc) and a brief reason for your conversion to the respective DD programme mentioning your interests etc. You also need to attach the course plan as mentioned above to your application mail after getting it approved by your FacAd.
        </p>
        <p>
          Once you are done with the above process there is nothing more that needs to be done from your side. First the approval of your course plan by your FacAd will be verified by the EE office. Your application will then be considered by the HOD and the DUGC  and once approved, the EE office will intimate the Academic office(UGAPEC) about the approval of your request for a conversion to DD from BTech. The Academic Office will then do the needful and finally you will get an email from the Academic office saying that the conversion process was successful and the necessary changes in academic records are being done. Your conversion(i.e. your new programme) will then be reflected on your ASC portal. On an ending note, I suggest getting in contact with the DGSec and he/she will guide you properly through the process. Note that my application got easily processed because I applied at an opportune moment well before the beginning of my final year, which is highly recommended. If you apply too close to the registration date, there is a possibility of your application getting delayed and then you will have to register for courses following your previous curriculum.
