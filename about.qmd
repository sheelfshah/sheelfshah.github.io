## About me

I am Sheel. I like to solve problems --- usually at the intersection of math and programming. This is what drove to study Reinforcement Learning, Probability, Statistics, and Machine Learning at IIT Bombay. With a very similar motivation, I joined Quadeye as a Quantitative Researcher to work on all kinds of problems in the high frequency trading space. Again, with a similar motivation, I am now an MSML student at Carnegie Mellon University. I am currently working on problems in Diffusion Models.

Outside of being a geek, I like to play the drums, travel, and trek. I am also a big fan of PewDiePie. I am also a health/fitness enthusiast. Here's my favorite joke:

<summary>Why did the chicken cross the road?</summary>
To get to the idiot's house.

Did you get it? No? Try this one:

<summary>Knock knock. (Who's there?)</summary>
The chicken.
